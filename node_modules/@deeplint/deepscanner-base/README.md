DeepScanner is a cloud agnostic framework that collects and extracts cloud based resources information from any cloud providers like AWS and Azure, and output the data in a pre-defined format for further analysis.

DeepScanner integrates seamlessly with [DeepLint](https://deeplint.com), the cloud linting tool, to help you easily build custom policies to validate your cloud environments.
